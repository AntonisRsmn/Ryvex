---

### 🛡️ Crash Protection & Stability

Ryvex is built to **never crash** in production:

- All event handlers wrapped in try/catch
- All database services wrapped with safe fallbacks — null-safe callers throughout
- All utilities (logging, automod) wrapped with error isolation
- Global `unhandledRejection` and `uncaughtException` handlers
- Automatic cache sweepers prevent memory leaks over long uptime
- Periodic spam tracker cleanup prevents memory buildup
- AutoMod runs before XP — deleted messages never earn XP
- Anti-raid kick targets all recent joiners, lock auto-restores after cooldown
- Slow commands (`/rank`, `/leaderboard`, `/antiraid`) use deferred replies to prevent timeouts

---

## ⚙️ Setup & Configuration

```
/setup          — 17-page interactive setup guide covering all systems
/settings view  — 10-page interactive dashboard showing all current config
```

Both commands use paginated embeds with ◀ ▶ navigation buttons.
